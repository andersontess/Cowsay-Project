# Cowsay-Project
- Basic use of Shell Scripts with arguments returning the "cowsay" command with different features
- Remaking the "cowsay" command using C in which the cow can be personalized (the cow can have other animal friends, etc.)
- Automating a "tamagoshi" type game in C in which users play against each other (or alone) to see who can keep their cow alive the longest
